## Task-1 :: Number Guessing Game using C++
The "Guess My Number" game is a console-based application implemented in the C++ programming language. This interactive game presents users with the challenge of guessing a randomly generated number within the range of 1 to 100. Players are free to make as many attempts as they wish in their quest to identify the mystery number. Upon making a guess, the game provides immediate feedback, guiding users to adjust their next guess by indicating whether the target number is higher or lower. The objective is to correctly guess the randomly generated number, and when this feat is accomplished, the game congratulates the player on their success and discloses the number of attempts it took to achieve victory. This implementation exemplifies a fundamental yet engaging use of C++ for interactive gaming, offering an intuitive and enjoyable experience for users while remaining accessible and comprehensible to developers and players alike.
